plus
,
android
is
developing
a
way
faster
than
ios
so
it
has
chances
to
become
a
laptop
replacement
earlier
than
ios
.

went
to
android
earlier
this
year
after
being
convinced
its
better
then
ios
apple
.

the
version
we
showed
here
is
ios
only
,
because
the
ios
code
supported
ibeacons
earlier
than
android
,
but
we
are
almost
finished
with
an
android
one
as
well
.

he
'
ll
quickly
realize
why
android
is
a
better
os
-
and
even
simpler
to
use
than
ios
for
most
daily
tasks
.

and
when
it
comes
to
a
os
being
simple
to
use
,
bada
is
simpler
to
use
than
android
(
and
lots
faster
too
),
but
bada
still
has
more
functions
than
ios
or
wp7
.

that
'
s
why
it
'
s
so
ridiculous
to
say
that
ios
is
simpler
to
use
than
android
.

in
my
view
,
ios
is
still
simpler
to
use
than
android
,
and
made
even
simpler
in
ios
7
.

as
much
as
i
hate
to
say
it
,
android
is
not
inferior
to
ios
any
longer
,
and
they
have
reached
parity
.

ios
is
still
good
,
but
no
longer
is
better
than
android
.

this
matters
very
little
from
a
usage
point
-
of
-
view
,
but
technically
this
aspect
of
ios
is
inferior
to
android
,
and
provides
the
illusion
of
longer
battery
life
.

ios
is
no
longer
smoother
than
android
,
at
least
in
4
.
3
jelly
bean
or
4
.
4
kit
kat
,
especially
on
the
moto
x
or
the
new
moto
droids
.

too
bad
android
has
been
around
longer
than
ios
.

oh
and
by
the
way
android
is
smarter
than
ios
.

android
is
a
smarter
mobile
os
choice
than
ios
:
10
reasons
why
.

try
to
search
for
tasker
which
is
only
one
reason
android
is
much
smarter
than
ios
and
ios
users
.

android
has
its
advantages
,
but
overall
,
it
remains
significantly
easier
to
write
good
ios
apps
than
good
android
apps
.

android
itself
is
getting
smoother
and
simpler
,
but
still
has
a
geekier
feel
than
apple
'
s
ios
operating
system
.

software
developers
believe
google
'
s
android
platform
has
a
better
long
-
term
outlook
,
better
technological
capabilities
,
and
greater
openness
than
apple
'
s
ios
platform
.

to
sum
up
,
while
the
android
platform
is
a
somewhat
safer
choice
than
apple
'
s
ios
in
terms
of
security
and
privacy
protection
,
none
of
the
two
aforementioned
platforms
is
indeed
secure
.

ios
users
read
slower
than
android
,
and
for
shorter
periods
of
time
.

android
users
were
always
saying
how
much
better
android
was
than
ios
.

that
'
s
interesting
,
as
i
'
ve
noticed
many
android
users
posting
in
this
subforum
comment
that
android
keyboards
,
and
in
particular
swiftkey
,
are
superior
to
ios
.

pro
-
android
users
argue
that
android
is
now
better
than
ios
for
a
myriad
of
reasons
.

consumers
of
any
android
device
do
things
faster
and
better
on
android
than
on
ios
,
this
has
been
true
since
the
very
first
consumer
version
of
android
.

android
is
superior
to
ios
,
imo
,
because
it
lets
consumers
be
the
boss
,
not
steve
jobs
.

this
means
that
ios
apps
are
not
only
better
than
android
apps
today
,
they
'
re
getting
better
faster
than
android
apps
because
apple
is
deploying
and
the
installed
base
is
rapidly
upgrading
to
much
more
powerful
apis
on
the
devices
in
consumers
'
hands
.

they
were
right
,
my
stance
has
always
been
that
android
is
superior
to
ios
due
to
the
choices
given
to
consumers
.

android
is
as
simple
or
simpler
than
ios
if
you
'
re
using
it
superficially
which
most
consumers
are
doing
.

i
picked
up
android
alot
easier
,
faster
than
ios
.

android
seems
faster
and
smoother
than
ios
,
but
only
on
nexus
smartphones
.

simply
put
android
is
easier
,
better
,
innovative
,
developing
than
ios
.

creating
an
android
app
is
easier
and
faster
than
with
ios
.

and
android
was
designed
to
be
adaptable
and
is
evolving
faster
and
nicer
than
ios
.

standard
android
based
platforms
may
be
easier
to
implement
than
the
blackberry
and
ios
platforms
.

@
kadajawi
:
technically
,
qt
for
ios
is
not
a
problem
and
even
easier
to
implement
than
for
android
.

i
find
ios
apps
are
way
smoother
and
work
better
than
android
.

ios
is
much
easier
to
do
,
and
looks
better
,
than
android
apps
.

ios
can
run
a
lot
smoother
and
apps
run
faster
on
lesser
hardware
than
a
beefed
up
android
device
.

the
ios
ecosystem
is
a
lot
nicer
in
that
stuff
works
and
there
are
more
and
better
apps
than
on
android
.

there
are
more
apps
on
ios
,
and
you
might
argue
that
the
ios
app
store
is
better
run
and
easier
to
use
than
the
android
marketplace
.

general
observations
:
colors
differ
slightly
between
the
devices
,
ios
is
lighter
than
android
.

iphone
dominates
in
benchmarks
because
a
)
it
is
new
b
)
ios
7
is
a
much
lighter
platform
than
android
.

the
ios
wallet
is
lighter
than
the
android
version
in
one
way
:
tap
-
to
-
pay
isn
'
t
included
because
it
requires
nfc
support
,
which
isn
'
t
available
on
ios
devices
.

i
do
agree
with
the
few
that
think
ios
apps
are
nicer
...
app
store
is
bigger
...
but
i
also
agree
android
is
catching
up
faster
than
apple
imagined
!

yet
if
you
say
ios
is
better
than
android
please
,
tell
why
,
not
just
say
ouuu
the
appstore
is
bigger
or
it
'
s
made
out
of
glass
and
/
or
metal
,
or
it
'
s
faster
than
android
phones
.

in
games
that
rely
more
on
bigger
purchases
,
ios
often
performs
better
than
android
.

anyway
ios
looks
better
than
android
but
android
being
open
source
is
more
versatile
usuable
and
will
be
able
to
evolve
into
bigger
and
better
things
.

android
is
bigger
than
ios
.

its
because
ios
and
windows
8
have
a
better
and
smoother
framework
than
android
.

6
)
ios
is
a
much
smoother
os
,
and
just
works
better
,
much
better
than
the
android
os
.

keep
in
mind
that
the
ios
4
is
more
mature
,
solid
,
smoother
and
is
easier
to
use
than
android
.

ios
provides
a
much
richer
set
of
both
cryptographic
and
key
management
infrastructure
than
android
.

ios
users
are
more
female
and
richer
than
android
users
,
especially
when
you
consider
tablets
,
the
more
likely
buying
device
.

speaking
in
london
,
sheryl
sandberg
said
that
android
,
google
'
s
mobile
operating
system
,
was
allowing
the
company
to
provide
a
richer
user
experience
than
apple
'
s
rival
ios
.

at
the
outset
i
must
say
that
the
reporting
for
android
apps
is
much
richer
and
superior
than
that
provided
by
apple
for
ios
.

if
you
know
the
makeup
of
any
of
these
major
cities
it
is
beyond
doubt
that
the
average
ios
user
is
richer
than
the
average
android
user
.

ios
is
has
a
better
user
experience
than
android
and
it
is
also
much
easier
to
develop
for
.

ios
is
sooooo
much
easier
to
develop
for
than
android
.

ios
is
far
easier
to
develop
for
than
android
and
we
always
do
ios
first
.

the
survey
also
found
,
perhaps
unsurprisingly
,
that
developers
find
both
ios
and
blackberry
easier
to
develop
for
than
android
.

"
android
because
it
'
s
more
secure
and
easier
to
develop
for
than
ios
"
.

i
think
this
makes
ios
devices
easier
to
learn
than
android
devices
.

android
development
is
easier
to
learn
than
ios
,
however
,
once
you
learn
ios
,
the
end
result
of
the
apps
is
by
far
more
impressive
than
android
.

for
newbies
,
the
ios
experience
is
easier
to
learn
than
any
of
the
various
flavors
of
android
os
with
mfr
customizations
.

apple
ios
(
for
iphones
,
ipads
,
ipod
touch
)
-
some
argue
that
apple
'
s
touch
response
is
noticeably
quicker
and
smoother
than
android
devices
,
and
this
has
only
improved
for
the
iphone
6
generation
,
which
features
sensors
on
the
surface
rather
than
beneath
.

there
'
s
a
reason
why
ios
often
looks
smoother
than
android
even
on
inferior
processing
power
and
that
'
s
because
iphones
always
have
top
of
the
line
gpus
.

i
can
fix
a
typo
...
but
android
still
sucks
and
is
inferior
to
ios
and
apple
and
iphones
and
you
can
'
t
fix
that
.

time
was
people
would
argue
ios
was
in
a
better
position
than
android
(
and
laugh
at
people
who
predicted
android
would
end
up
beating
ios
)
because
there
were
more
iphones
being
sold
than
android
devices
.

with
added
security
in
ios
it
really
feels
safer
on
apple
devices
than
on
android
devices
.

why
ios
is
safer
than
android
.

one
reason
that
ios
is
safer
than
android
is
that
bug
fixes
to
the
operating
system
are
rolled
out
faster
.

ios
apps
are
generally
safer
than
android
apps
.

why
ios
is
safer
than
android
the
relative
vulnerability
of
android
vs
.
ios
comes
down
to
the
level
of
control
the
vendors
have
over
products
and
the
marketplace
for
development
and
distribution
of
apps
.

for
me
personally
,
ios
is
still
easier
and
faster
(
and
simpler
)
to
use
for
everyday
living
,
which
is
probably
why
my
iphone
5
gets
more
use
than
my
note
2
but
obviously
,
the
customization
and
freedom
is
better
on
android
.

for
managing
devices
in
the
enterprise
,
however
,
ios
has
been
far
simpler
with
better
capabilities
than
android
by
far
.

of
course
,
the
reactions
are
priceless
,
with
almost
everyone
saying
ios
is
better
and
simpler
than
android
after
praising
the
android
-
equipped
iphone
.

for
normal
people
like
me
(
no
geeks
wannabe
)
ios
is
simpler
,
faster
,
leaner
,
stable
and
friendly
than
android
os
up
to
now
.

ios
is
a
simpler
os
in
comparison
to
android
.

fuzzier
regions
like
python
is
easier
to
read
than
ruby
,
stating
.

ruby
is
a
bad
choice
because
multiplication
seems
slower
in
ruby
than
in
python
.

ruby
2
.
1
added
a
feature
to
use
gmp
for
large
multiplication
,
but
it
still
seems
slower
than
python
2
.
7
.

i
find
the
python
version
of
that
test
easier
to
read
,
and
i
'
ve
been
using
ruby
almost
10
years
longer
than
python
.

i
think
that
python
is
a
lot
easier
to
read
than
ruby
or
java
.

python
is
usually
fast
enough
for
what
you
want
it
to
do
(
and
faster
than
ruby
),
while
requires
a
third
of
the
code
of
an
equivalent
java
program
and
is
much
easier
to
read
.

my
primary
language
,
though
,
is
likely
to
remain
python
,
as
i
find
it
about
60
million
times
easier
to
read
than
perl
,
and
100
million
times
easier
to
read
than
ruby
.

performance
is
the
main
downfall
,
with
python
being
somewhat
faster
than
ruby
as
i
understand
it
.

java
has
,
in
some
cases
,
the
performance
of
c
++
or
at
least
half
the
performance
of
it
,
while
ruby
is
(
afair
)
18
times
slower
than
c
.
python
is
better
,
but
is
not
in
java
territory
.

the
only
things
python
have
going
for
it
are
a
comprehensive
library
,
better
than
ruby
performance
,
and
mindshare
.

it
'
s
much
more
widely
known
,
and
all
the
benchmarks
i
'
ve
seen
also
show
python
as
rather
faster
than
ruby
,
and
django
as
higher
-
performance
than
rails
.

arguably
,
the
mature
c
integration
tools
available
to
python
make
it
far
better
suited
to
high
performance
computing
than
ruby
.

the
python
code
appears
to
be
4
times
faster
than
the
ruby
code
:
.

all
he
'
s
saying
(
literally
)
is
that
ruby
1
.
8
was
in
the
range
of
5
times
slower
than
python
2
.
5
and
ruby
1
.
9
is
in
the
range
of
3
times
faster
than
python
2
.
5
when
running
this
exact
code
.

ruby
is
1
.
7
times
slower
than
perl
,
tcl
is
3
.
3
times
slower
,
and
python
is
8
.
2
times
slower
!

it
'
s
time
to
show

python
weapon
-
calculation
of
same
fibonacci
numbers
but
in
1000
times
faster
than
antonio
'
s
ruby
implementation
.

the
only
drawback
i
would
consider
is
that
ruby
is
about
10x
slower
than
python
(
as
far
as
i
know
),
due
to
the
lack
of
a
bytecode
format
.

no
bearing
on
the
original
topic
,
and
i
may
just
be
calling
out
a
typo
,
but
for
the
record
the
current
python
implementation
is
much
faster
than
the
implementations
of
ruby
,
perl
,
or
php
because
it
uses
java
-
esque
bytecode
partial
-
compilation
.

i
feel
python
to
be
an
easier

to
learn
than

an

science

on

seconds
for
python
vs
.
46

for

python
is
better
than
ruby
,
i
have
no
doubt
in
my
mind
,
but
if
we
let
ruby
become
-
faster
-
than
python
,
people
will
gravitate
away
from
python
.

-
i
hate
ruby
,
because
it
'
s
slow
,
even
slower
than
java
or
python
.

python
has
a
much
greater
range
of
libraries
available
to
it
,
and
most
of
those
libraries
are
more
mature
and
better
documented
than
their
ruby
counterparts
.

python
,
overall
,
has
far
greater
usage
than
ruby
.

my
point
was
that
for
a
dynamic
pl
,
the
correctness
guaranteed
by
ruby
in
not
much
better
than
that
guaranteed
by
python
(
as
frank
has
pointed
out
often
,
and
with
much
greater
expressiveness
and
zeal
than
i
can
muster
).

on
the
other
hand
,
ruby
also
has
much
greater
syntactic
flexibility
than
python
.

when
i
started
learning
haskell
then
some
where
it
was
given
that
because
of
type
checking
haskell
is
faster
than
python
.

what
i
like
best
about
python
(
its
ability
to
be
both
functional
and
imperative
)
is
left
a
little
inferior
to
haskell
because
of
its
lack
of
the
beauty
that
is
the
haskell
type
system
.

when
i
last
checked
the
benchmark
game
speed
comparisons
,
javascript
v8
was
slower
than
most
of
the
explicitly
typed
and
type
inference
languages
like
haskell
and
ocaml
,
but
much
faster
than
other
languages
without
explicit
types
like
python
,
ruby
and
perl
.

haskell
is
faster
than
c
++,
more
concise
than
perl
,
more
regular
than
python
,
more
flexible
than
ruby
,
more
typeful
than
c
#,
more
robust
than
java
,
and
has
absolutely
nothing
in

update
2007

:
of
course
,
the
python
version
is
not
easier
to
grok
than
this
alternative
haskell
version
:
.

also
,
haskell
code
runs
a
lot
faster
than
python
code
(
real
native
-
code
compiler
that
can
use
multicore
hardware
),
and
there
is
a
clever
automatic
unit
testing
system
(
quickcheck
)
that
relies
on
haskell
'
s
static
type
system
to
generate
random
tests
automatically
.

i
'
ve
no
problem
with
recognizing
that
haskell
is
much
faster
than
python
and
that
python
is
faster
than
ruby
in
most
scenarios
.

scheme
,
ocaml
,
haskell
,
and
lisp
are
all
an
order
of
magnitude
faster
than
python
.

haskell
compiled
to
native
code
is
typically
an
order
of
magnitude
faster
than
python
.

--
--
quick
implementation
by
dmwit
on
#
haskell
--
faster
,
shorter
,
uses
less
memory
than
the
python
version
.

you
can
go
ahead
and
right
some
code
without
static
type
checking
in
python
,
and
you
might
even
write
it
faster
than
you
would
have
in
haskell
.

it
is
also
true
that
python
programs
are
easier
to
install
than
haskell
.

hence
the
haskell
is
over
an
order
of
magnitude
slower
than
most
languages
and
even
slower
than
python
(!)

bash
scripting
is
more
easier
then
python
:)
.

bash
:
sometimes
it
'
s
easier
to
write
a
script
in
bash
rather
than
in
python
.

bash
is
great
for
interfacing
with
existing
command
-
line
tools
...
frequently
a
single
pipe
to
awk
or
grep
is
much
easier
than
the
python
alternative
.

since
python
supports
objects
it
'
s
easier
to
write
complex
scripts
than
with
bash
.

i
use
the
bourne
shell
for
portability
,
bash
for
its
greater
power
than
sh
(
arrays
,
etc
.),
ksh
when
bash
is
not
available
and
python
when
i
need
speed
and
greater
power
than
bash
.

running
bash
scripts
is
slightly
lighter
than
running
perl
/
python
/
whatever
scripts
on
top
of
bash
.

sure
,
if
you
do
nothing
but
use
bash
,
it
might
be
lighter
,
but
when
you
use
python
or
perl
,
you
'
re
not
spawning
processes
left
and
right
for
grep
,
sed
,
etc
.,
the
whole
toolkit
you
need
to
actually
get
any
work
done
in
shell
.

python
is
faster
than
bash
usually
,
so
i
think
i
'
ll
just
adjust
it
.

python
is
about
80
%
faster
than
bash
because
it
is
byte
compiled
while
base
is
interperated
.

a
simple
python
script
is
likely
to
be
faster
than
anything
you
can
do
in
bash
.

for
1st
,
bash
was
nearly
3
times
faster
than
python
.

i
find
python
easier
to
program
in
than
bash
,
you
don
'
t
have
to
deal
with
hordes
of
escaping
scenarios
,
for
one
.

but
any
shell
script
which
is
longer
than
10
lines
is
already
broken
and
needs
to
be
replaced
with
a
modern
,
maintainable
and
readable
programming
language
,
such
as
python
(
and
many
others
,
even
perl
is
much
better
than
bash
in
this
area
).

python
is
the
only
scripting
language
aside
from
shell
/
bash
that
i
use
nowadays
but
i
find
it
can
often
take
longer
to
hack
up
a
quick
little
tool
in
python
than
it
would
have
to
do
it
in
c
or
java
because
of
getting
stuck
with
some
shitty
bug
in
a
module
.

javascript
is
better
(
imo
)
and
faster
than
python
.

most
javascript
interpreters
are
much
faster
than
nearly
all
implementations
of
python
.

javascript
in
v8
executes
about
ten
times
faster
than
python
3
(
shootout
.
alioth
.
debian
.
org
/
u32
/...
).

though
thanks
to
v8
,
it
executes
javascript
faster
than
php
,
python
and
ruby
.

otherwise
javascript
has
become
amazingly
fast
,
i
think
v8
is
faster
then
ruby
and
python
.

one
thing
about
javascript
being
faster
than
python
:
one
needs
to
distinguish
between
a
language
and
its
implementation
.

in
practice
,
javascript
tends
to
be
a
lot
faster
than
python
,
not
because
of
any
feature
of
the
languages
themselves
-
they
'
re
broadly
comparable
in
terms
of
expressiveness
and
capabilities
-
but
because
companies
like
microsoft
,
google
,
and
mozilla
have
invested
heavily
in
making
javascript
faster
.

also
,
google
'
s
open
source
v8
compiler
is
so
freaking
fast
,
javascript
is
now
reliably
faster
than
java
,
python
,
perl
,
and
other
interpreted
languages
.

the
use
of
javascript
has
lower
the
barrier
for
making
contributions
for
gnome
desktop
,
because
javascript
it
'
s
a
well
known
language
in
the
web
development
world
an
it
'
s
a
easier
language
to
learn
than
the
typical
c
/
c
++
and
even
python
.

python
isn
'
t
pascal
but
it
'
s
way
better
than
all
the
toothless
c
wannabees
that
represent
the
sum
total
of
recent
language
research
,
especially
javascript
,
the
woodrow
wilson
of
programming
languages
.

these
apps
perform
surprisingly
well
,
partly
because
the
chrome
javascript
engine
is
very
fast
--
faster
than
python
in
some
tests
--
but
also
because
the
chrome
apis
are
fairly
thin
layers
over
native
os
apis
.

picking
a
random
benchmark
shows
v8
(
chrome
'
s
javascript
engine
,
which
is
embedded
in
o3d
)
to
be
300x
faster
than
python
,
and
i
know
python
is
easily
fast
enough
to
make
a
decent
game
in
.

when
you
are
interested
in
evaluating
just
one
--
known
--
javascript
function
,
it
may
be
easier
to
implement
this
function
in
python
rather
than
pull
in
a
huge
tool
that
is
built
to
parse
and
run
all
imaginable
javascript
in
the
world
.

anecdotally
,
i
'
d
say
that
python
code
is
(
on
the
surface
)
easier
to
understand
than
javascript
code
,
making
it
easier
to
vote
up
,
although
fiddles
help
your
javascript
answers
because
you
can
prove
your
code
works
.

just
attempting
to
generalize
our
collective
experience
that
writing
a
moderately
complex
gui
in
python
,
java
and
flash
is
so
much
easier
than
writing
a
gui
in
javascript
.

if
you
are
a
proficient
java
programmer
but
are
unfamiliar
with
python
or
tcl
,
you
may
find
it
easier
to
get
going
writing
scripts
with
javascript
or
beanshell
than
you
will
with
jython
or
jacl
,
since
there
is
less
new
ground
to
cover
.

because
i
found
python
to
be
alot
more
simpler
to
learn
than
javascript
in
many
ways
.

notice
how
much
cleaner
and
simpler
the
python
code
is
compared
to
the
javascript
version
.

in
general
,
debugging
javascript
code
is
not
as
easy
as
debugging
your
python
code
although
firebug
has
made
the
problem
much
simpler
already
.

python
unicode
support
has
always
seemed
trivial
to
me
,
and
much
better
than
the
other
languages
i
'
ve
worked
with
(
c
,
php
,
perl
,
ruby
,
javascript
,
actionscript
).

javascript
is
even
more
dynamic
than
python
in
many
ways
,
and
it
'
s
seen
drastic
speedups
with
primitive
first
-
generation
jit
compilers
,
all
with
no
changes
to
the
language
(
especially
since
it
'
s
standardized
.)

as
python
code
running
in
silverlight
runs
faster
than
javascript
(
and
python
is
a
nicer
language
of
course
),
you
could
even
use
silverlight
as
an
optional
accelerator
for
rias
(
rich
internet
applications
)
-
falling
back
to
javascript
when
silverlight
is
unavailable
.

i
dont
know
if
you
ever
coded
something
in
groovy
,
python
or
ruby
,
but
i
can
assure
you
that
its
really
a
better
experience
than
javascript
.

javascript
/
node
.
js
-
faster
execution
than
perl
,
and
much
easier
to
write
async
code
.

i
'
d
argue
it
'
s
much
easier
to
write
bad
code
in
perl
than
javascript
,
but
at
least
it
doesn
'
t
insert
semicolons
for
you
.

if
you
think
the
javascript
was
easy
to
follow
,
wait
until
you
see
the
perl
scripts
that
implement
the
web
services
;
they
'
re
even
easier
to
understand
and
debug
.

i
really
don
'
t
like
to
say
that
perl
is
harder
than
say
php
or
javascript
,
because
i
don
'
t
think
its
a
complete
apple
to
apple
'
s
comparison
,
although
it
is
often
cast
that
way
.

javascript
will
likely
have
a
greater
impact
on
the
use
of
cgi
/
perl
than
java
.

you
need
to
look
no
further
than
the
developer
'
s
wiki
and
search
for
perl
:
developer
'
s
guide
afaik
,
anyways
,
it
'
s
easier
to
develop
them
using
python
and
javascript
.

they
say
kennedy
won
because
he
was
better
on
camera
than
nixon
.

kennedy
emerged
the
apparent
winner
from
this
first
of
four
televised
debates
,
partly
owing
to
his
greater
ease
before
the
camera
than
nixon
,
who
,
unlike
kennedy
,
seemed
nervous
and
declined
to
wear
makeup
.

many
voters
in
1960
chose
the
more
charismatic
john
f
.
kennedy
over
richard
nixon
,
a
man
who
rarely
looked
comfortable
on
camera
.

schneider
:
judy
,
kennedy
won
because
he
looked
better
than
nixon
did
on
television
.

kennedy
performs
better
on
television
than
nixon
,
and
it
is
believed
that
television
helps
kennedy
win
the
election
.

john
f
.
kennedy
understood
the
power
of
television
better
than
richard
nixon
during
the
race
for
the
presidency
in
1960
.

kennedy
came
across
much
better
on
television
than
the
ill
,
pale
,
sweating
nixon
and
won
the
debate
and
ultimately
the
presidency
.

the
nation
tuned
in
for
that
first
debate
where
senator
kennedy
famously
looked
better
on
black
and
white
television
than
richard
nixon
.

i
am
voting
for
senator
kennedy
because
i
think
he
'
s
a
much
greater
statesman
than
vice
president
nixon
.

[
35
]
frank
mullin
said
kennedy
better
expressed
the
views
of
the
american
public
than
vice
president
nixon
.

second
,
the
televised
debates
as
the
campaign
'
s
defining
events
:
many
journalists
and
voters
judged
kennedy
to
have
done
better
than
his
republican
rival
,
vice
president
richard
nixon
.

the
same
thing
happened
many
years
ago
with
a
younger
,
more
sophisticated
,
but
unknown
member
of
the
kennedy
clan
who
looked
better
in
a
televised
debate
than
a
tired
,
older
,
heavily
perspiring
vice
-
president
named
nixon
.

during
the
1960
presidential
campaign
,
john
f
.
kennedy
got
better
coverage
from
the
media
than
did
his
opponent
richard
m
.
nixon
.

i
was
five
years
old
in
1960
and
i
wanted
kennedy
to
win
the
presidential
election
because
he
was
much
better
looking
than
nixon
.

what
mattered
on
election
day
for
jack
kennedy
was
that
he
was
a
much
better
man
and
would
make
a
far
better
president
than
richard
fucking
nixon
,
as
later
events
proved
.

kennedy
,
however
,
did
wear
the
make
-
up
and
so
appeared
cooler
and
more
composed
than
nixon
.

kennedy
was
cooler
than
nixon
-
actually
,
nixon
in
1968
and
1972
is
the
exception
to
this
rule
,
and
you
know
how
that
turned
out
.

many
have
suggested
that
kennedy
ultimately
won
the
1960
election
because
he
was
just
easier
to
look
at
than
richard
nixon
.

just
for
the
record
,
i
voted
for
kennedy
in
the
1968
california
democratic
primary
so
i
would
agree
that
,
by
that
time
,
he
was
better
then
his
opponent
,
gene
mccarthy
and
certainly
far
superior
to
the
mentally
unstable
richard
nixon
.

but
those
who
watched
on
tv
thought
that
kennedy
had
won
,
many
said
because
kennedy
simply
looked
better
than
nixon
,
who
had
been
sick
in
previous
days
.

these
days
,
nixon
is
held
in
higher
esteem
than
kennedy
only
because
his
misbehavior
wasn
'
t
sexual
.

in
first
grade
,
he
supported
john
f
.
kennedy
,
because
he
was
catholic
,
like
stone
,
and
he
had
better
hair
than
nixon
.

robinson
,
it
turns
out
,
actually
campaigned
for
nixon
in
1960
,
in
the
belief
that
he
would
be
better
for
civil
rights
than
kennedy
-
but
not
,
apparently
,
better
than
hubert
humphrey
,
who
did
not
receive
the
democratic
nomination
.

nixon
was
thought
to
be
smarter
than
kennedy
.

or
perhaps
the
example
of
richard
nixon
,
tricky
dick
who
was
considered
smarter
than
kennedy
and
humphrey
.

and
all
of
this
,
despite
the
fact
that
the
nixon
press
operation
was
far
smoother
than
the
kennedy
operation
.

in
an
attempt
to
make
the
electoral
college
seem
even
worse
than
it
is
,
edwards
claims
that
richard
nixon
received
more
popular
votes
in
1960
than
john
kennedy
did
.

hopefully
a
mouse
will
decompose
quicker
than
a
full
sized
rat
!!

we
have
found
that
blood
carbon
and
nitrogen
turnover
was
roughly
equivalent
in
mice
and
in
rats
,
and
that
mouse
blood
turned
over
slightly
faster
than
rat
blood
.

they
found
that
rodents
have
mutated
about
three
times
faster
than
humans
over
the
past
80
million
years
or
so
,
and
that
the
rat
is
mutating
slightly
faster
than
the
mouse
.

a
combination
of
mouse
and
guinea
pig
transcriptomes
was
used
because
the
annotation
of
the
mouse
genome
is
better
than
that
of
the
guinea
pig
while
the
guinea
pig
genome
is
more
similar
to
that
of
the
naked
mole
-
rat
.

a
mouse
can
be
a
little
easier
to
trap
than
a
rat
,
but
using
these
principles
,
it
doesn
'
t
matter
.

9
in
addition
,
we
have
found
that
mouse
tissue
is
much
easier
to
process
and
microdissect
than
the
equivalent
rat
tissue
(
unpublished
observation
).

although
mice
tend
to
be
used
more
widely
in
research
--
largely
because
manipulating
the
genes
of
a
mouse
has
been
easier
than
those
of
the
rat
--
rats
are
in
many
cases
still
the
research
model
of
choice
.

fewer
total
small
-
diameter
neurons
from
rat
responded
to
cinn
,
but
the
responsive
neurons
in
rat
had
greater
response
amplitudes
than
those
from
mouse
(
figs
.
5a
,
b
).

rat
myocytes
were
chosen
for
these
experiments
as
they
showed
greater
viability
in
a
cell
culture
system
than
isolated
mouse
myocytes
.

it
'
s
pretty
easy
to
train
a
rat
,
easier
than
a
mouse
.

mice
are
smaller
and
easier
to
work
with
than
rats
,
so
i
'
d
definitely
recommend
trying
this
with
a
mouse
first
.

because
the
rat
is
bigger
,
it
is
easier
to
study
diseases
in
rats
than
in
the
mouse
.

most
studies
have
used
rat
and
human
atii
cells
because
they
are
easier
to
isolate
and
culture
than
mouse
atii
cells
.

it
all
starts
from
correctly
dissecting
out
the
aorta
from
the
animal
initially
,
but
i
would
guess
that
rat
aortas
would
be
easier
than
a
mouse
and
we
routinely
perform
this
on
mouse
aortas
.

a
team
of
scientists
led
by
drug
maker
wyeth
-
ayerst
and
johns
hopkins
have
engineered
and
tested
a
new
rat
model
of
lou
gehrig
'
s
disease
they
say
is
far
easier
to
work
with
than
earlier
mouse
models
.

naturally
the
rat
came
since
a
rat
is
bigger
than
a
mouse
.

today
,
i
was
taught
a
rat
is
bigger
than
a
mouse
.

a
gerbil
is
smaller
than
a
rat
but
bigger
than
a
mouse
.

mesothelioma
rat
model
was
then

a

dimensions
since
the

than
the
lexus
is
350c
,
finding
a
wide
enough
spot
in
a
parking
lot
may
be
a
bit
more
challenging
.

audi
is
superior
in
some
aspects
but
after
riding
in
lexus
found
lexus
not
to
be
inferior
to
audi
in
some
things
.

in
no
way
is
lexus
inferior
to
bmw
/
audi
/
benz
3
.

lexus
is
inferior
to
bmw
,
mb
,
and
audi
in
the
performance
segment
.

we
have
had
some
healthy
debate
over
the
past
few
days
and
i
would
like
to
give
some
reasons
why
lexus
is
inferior
to
audi
,
bmw
and
mercedes
benz
.

we
should
say
that
lexus
is
inferior
,
when
compared
to
bmw
,
mb
,
and
audi
when
it
comes
to
performance
.

the
bmw
-
mercedes
benz
and
now
audi
have
always
been
superior
to
lexus
.

one
commercial
,
for
example
,
portrays
audi
as
a
better
alternative
to
a
lexus
,
mercedes
and
even
a
ferrari
.

audi
joined
the
top
league
when
it
came
out
with
the
advertisement
which
mentioned
,
audi
is
growing
faster
than
bmw
,
lexus
&
mercedes
.

lexus
is
definitely
on
par
with
if
not
better
than
mercedes
,
bmw
,
or
audi
.

in
the
d
segment
audi
was
again
headed
by
bmw
and
mercedes
-
benz
but
better
than
lexus
.

my
lexus
had
vibrations
with
road
force
greater
than
10
my
audi
vibrated
with
road
force
greater
than
15
my
mercedes
vibrated
with
road
force
greater
than
12
.

plus
lexus
cars
are
far
better
to
drive
than
bmw
'
s
and
bentley
'
s
and
certainly
better
than
audi
.

outhandles
a
bmw
,
more
reliable
than
a
lexus
,
better
made
than
a
audi
,
safer
than
a
volvo
.

maximum
brake
testing
further
betrayed
the
catera
'
s
weight
with
a
60
-
to
-
zero
distance
of
131
feet
;
6
feet
more
than
a
1999
bmw
328i
and
9
feet
more
than
an
audi
a4
2
.
8
quattro
we
tested
last
year
,
and
17
feet
more
than
a
lexus
is
300
we
tested
last
month
(
all
of
which
are
over
400
pounds
lighter
than
the
caddy
).

i
thought
lexus
was
supposed
to
be
a
better
value
than
benz
/
bmw
/
audi
.

lexus
has
a
better
brand
value
proposition
than
volvo
or
infiniti
,
and
reliability
is
unquestionably
higher
than
the
bmw
or
audi
competition
.

when
it
comes
to
resale
values
,
we
expect
the
2012
buick
verano
to
offer
long
-
term
residual
numbers
similar
to
the
audi
a3
but
worse
than
the
lexus
is
and
acura
tsx
.

i
cannot
say
this
mattered
to
me
a
great
deal
,
since
i
keep
my
cars
a
long
time
,
and
since
i
expect
any
resale
value
on
the
lexus
would
have
been
greater
than
on
the
audi
,
but
it
is
more
expensive
.

in
a
pure
performance
mode
,
the
lexus
rc
f
really
seems
to
take
the
cake
,
a
full
two
seconds
faster
than
the
bmw
m4
and
audi
rs
5
.

audi
is
faster
than
lexus
.

the
lexus
rc
comes
only
with
a
v
-
6
,
but
it
doesn
'
t
feel
appreciably
faster
than
the
turbocharged
cadillac
,
likely
due
to
the
extra
weight
it
'
s
lugging
around
.

the
2007
cadillac
xlr
is
faster
than
its
competitors
from
mercedes
-
benz
,
lexus
and
jaguar
;
and
offers
fresh
,
distinctive
styling
.

the
problem
was
cadillac
couldn
'
t
make
the
magic
after
1980
and
the
1985
front
drivers
were
constantly
delayed
because
cadillac
realized
it
was
making
the
wrong
car
:
a
tiny
,
lightweight
front
wheel
drive
sedan
that
was
ugly
and
under
powered
-
when
buyers
were
buying
a
better
engineered
,
faster
,
yet
more
expensive
cars
from
mercedes
,
then
lexus
and
others
.

the
lexus
is
very
nice
maybe
even
nicer
than
a
cadillac
(
whole
different
thread
)
but
that
thread
would
be
a
much
closer
comparison
.

this
was
my
first
cadillac
/
domestic
car
in
general
,
as
i
am
an
import
type
of
guy
and
i
would
have
to
say
that
cadillacs
are
much
nicer
than
mercedes
and
lexus
'
as
far
as
luxury
goes
.

the
cadillac
ats
is
slightly
shorter
than
the
lexus
gs
350
,
which
may
make
it
easier
to
park
.

dimensions
the
cadillac
ats
is
a
little
narrower
than
the
lexus
gs
350
,
so
you
'
ll
have
an
easier
time
getting
in
and
out
of
the
car
in
a
tight
parking
spot
.

those
buick
radios
are
just
a
whole
lost
nicer
than
the
stock
cadillac
radios
.

buick
is
a
much
,
much
bigger
seller
in
china
-
the
chinese
seem
to
prefer
the
rounded
styling
of
most
current
buicks
to
the
edgy
,
expressive
design
language
of
the
current
cadillac
model
line
-
up
.

just
as
long
as
they
make
buick
the
equivalent
or
slightly
better
than
what
cadillac
is
now
.

the
307
in
the
buick
and
olds
wouldn
'
t
set
any
speed
records
,
but
they
were
faster
than
the
cadillac
,
way
more
reliable
,
and
ran
forever
.

cadillac
will
be
able
to
command
a
higher
price
than
buick
would
be
able
to
,
thus
helping
to
pay
off
development
costs
of
teh
voltec
and
allow
gm
to
lower
the
prices
for
this
technology
faster
.

notably
,
buick
earned
a
higher
average
road
-
test
score
than
cadillac
but
was
hurt
by
weak
reliability
.

in
1940
,
buick
had
a
higher
horsepower
engine
than
the
cadillac
at
141
horsepower
vs
.
cadillac
'
s
140
.

as
most
of
you
may
know
in
china
the
"
buick
"
name
plate
actually
holds
a
slightly
higher
status
than
does
cadillac
.

cadillac
has
sharper
lines
,
appealing
to
an
edgier
personality
than
softer
and
smoother
buick
.

a
buick
lacrosse
is
a
lot
more
vehicle
for
the
money
than
a
cadillac
ats
,
too
,
but
only
if
you
want
a
bigger
,
softer
,
floatier
,
highway
-
bound
sedan
.

although
it
'
s
my
understanding
that
the
chinese
don
'
t
like
the
cadillac
design
language
with
all
the
angles
and
creases
,
rather
they
prefer
the
softer
,
rounded
shapes
that
buick
uses
.

gm
was
the
worst
because
then
had
to
make
a
cadillac
better
than
an
oldsmobile
,
which
was
better
than
a
buick
,
which
was
better
than
a
pontiac
,
which
was
better
than
a
chevy
.

i
also
remember
cadillacs
of
this
vintage
would
show
rust
rather
quickly
-
they
weren
'
t
better
than
an
oldsmobile
or
buick
in
that
regard
.

still
,
though
cadillac
sales
were
flat
last
year
at
235
,
000
cars
,
it
'
s
in
better
shape
than
,
say
,
pontiac
,
buick
,
or
saturn
.

the
model
overlap
is
to
close
together
to
make
a
cadillac
better
than
a
buick
,
buick
better
than
chevy
...
.

buick
automobiles
are
in
the
middle
,
as
well
,
of
the
general
motors
lineup
,
above
the
mainstream
chevrolet
and
below
the
luxury
cadillac
nameplate
.

according
to
cadillac
,
the
escalade
records
about
13
-
per
-
cent
better
highway
fuel
consumption
than
the
mercedes
-
benz
gl550
and
almost
17
-
per
-
cent
greater
than
the
lexus
lx
570
and
land
rover
range
rover
.

finally
,
one
thing
not
mentioned
in
the
review
that
i
saw
in
person
was
the
incredible
2nd
row
leg
room
...
better
than
the
cadillac
and
considerably
greater
than
the
lexus
....
which
sacrificed
2nd
row
legroom
for
the
3rd
row
.

cadillac
says
that
the
escalade
'
s
epa
highway
rating
of
21
mpg
is
17
percent
higher
than
that
of
the
previous
model
,
and
significantly
better
than
that
of
either
the
mercedes
-
benz
gl550
or
lexus
lx
570
.

i
don
'
t
really
think
lexus
is
looked
at
as
higher
class
than
cadillac
.

cadillac
,
lincoln
and
jaguar
all
score
higher
than
mb
,
along
with
the
usual
suspects
,
lexus
,
infiniti
,
toyota
,
honda
,
etc
.:
.

those
numbers
,
cadillac
points
out
,
are
better
than
the
horsepower
and
torque
numbers
for
comparable
v6
engines
driving
such
competitive
vehicles
as
the
mercedes
-
benz
e
-
class
and
the
lexus
es
350
.

the
cadillac
srx
has
a
little
more
horsepower
than
the
lexus
rx
350
.

my
best
analogy
to
the
article
is
:
cadillac
is
better
than
lexus
because
they
sold
more
vehicles
in
the
us
we
all
know
that
the
conclusion
doesn
'
t
fit
the
statement
because
of
several
factors
(
cost
,
availability
,
etc
).

my
dad
bought
a
cadillac
suv
which
he
now
said
sucks
compared
to
the
comparable
priced
audi
suv
and
nothing
rides
smoother
and
quieter
than
a
full
size
lexus
.

and
cadillac
currently
has
the
momentum
to
be
better
than
bmw
,
let
alone
lexus
.

hands
down
,
the
cadillac
dts
offers
better
fuel
economy
and
price
than
a
lexus
430
.

so
how
you
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
equus
isn
'
t
as
refined
as
a
cadillac
but
would
be
as
refined
as
a
lexus
is
beyond
comprehension
.

bottom
line
,
the
nokia
lumia
810
has
been
a
much
smarter
smartphone
than
my
samsung
galaxy
s
.
.

i
no
more
defend
that
nokia
is
superior
to
samsung
as
i
did
all
tese
days
.

analysts
expect
samsung
to
post
a
6
%
rise
yoy
but
a
18
%
qoq
drop
,
which
is
far
worse
than
nokia
6
-
7
%
drop
(
which
however
is
a
3x
rise
compared
to
holidays
2012
).

who
doesn
'
t
favor
samsung
over
nokia
these
days
.

samsung
claims
a
20
.
3
%
market
share
,
leaving
nokia
--
a
long
-
standing
favorite
since
presmartphone
days
--
with
14
.
3
%.

still
leaning
towards
the
900
like
what
i
am
seeing
about
the
polycarnate
body
and
hoping
that
nokia
update
process
will
be
easier
and
less
wait
time
than
samsung
focus
.

yeah
,
it
'
s
much
easier
to
compete
with
nokia
than
samsung
.

nokia
is
much
more
easier
to
operate
then
with
the
samsung
s3
for
example
.

however
,
the
default
screen
resolution
of
the
samsung
device
is
richer
than
the
nokia
phone
.

the
nokia
n8
has
a
much
better
camera
,
the
samsung
galaxy
s
has
a
richer
screen
of
a
similar
size
and
the
iphone
4
has
a
way
better
app
support
.

...
nokia
will
do
a
far
better
wp8
than
samsung
....

so
of
course
nokia
can
sell
better
than
samsung
and
htc
'
s
wp8
.

nokia
makes
the
best
hardware
(
in
all
wp8
phone
)
much
better
than
samsung
.

bold
words
indeed
,
for
they
imply
that
the
upcoming
wp8
nokia
lumia
smartphones
will
somehow
be
better
than
what
samsung
proudly
unveiled
on
wednesday
.

samsung
is
constantly
updating
their
wp8
apps
,
more
than
nokia
does
.

not
really
true
-
nokia
nok
had
a
prototype
touchscreen
before
the
iphone
was
launched
,
and
its
smartphones
were
technologically
superior
to
anything
apple
aapl
,
samsung
,
or
google
goog
had
to
offer
during
the
late
1990s
.

smartphone
wars
:
nokia
asha
vs
samsug
rex
don
'
t
be
surprised
,
for
the
nokia
asha
series
smartphones
offer
better
gaming
,
music
,
internet
and
social
experience
than
phones
that
come
under
the
samsung
rex
brand
.

yes
,
i
agree
with
you
robert
,
that
nokia
has
been
weak
at
communicating
its
strategy
-
but
its
strategy
nonetheless
,
is
far
better
in
smartphones
than
those
of
motorola
,
sonyericsson
,
samsung
,
lg
or
any
other
legacy
dumbphone
makers
.

amazingly
,
despite
the
massive
discrepancy
in
screen
size
,
the
samsung
galaxy
nexus
is
both
thinner
and
lighter
than
the
nokia
lumia
800
.

off
,
the
prototype
n8
posted
a
score
54
-
percent
higher
than
the
samsung
omnia
hd
and
180
-
percent
greater
than
the
nokia
n97
.

other
manufacturers
-
notably
samsung
-
have
caught
up
much
quicker
than
apple
thought
,
and
microsoft
/
nokia
,
instead
of
playing
to
their
strengths
in
the
mass
market
,
have
gone
for
higher
end
phones
.

nokia
lumia
928
has
higher
user
rating
than
samsung
galaxy
s4
on
verizon
.

the
nokia
lumia
930
has
a
higher
-
resolution
sensor
than
the
samsung
galaxy
s5
.

in
other
words
,
samsung
was
registering
higher
revenues
in
india
than
nokia
by
selling
fewer
phones
.

in
a
conference
call
with
analysts
,
mr
.
ollila
said
that
nokia
planned
to
introduce
31
new
models
this
year
,
including
about
6
of
the
flip
-
top
type
that
samsung
and
motorola
were
quicker
to
unveil
.

comparing
night
mode
on
the
galaxy
s4
zoom
versus
the
nokia
lumia
1020
,
i
find
that
the
lumia
1020
is
able
to
take
shots
much
quicker
and
that
camera
doesn
'
t
need
to
do
the
multiple
exposure
and
stitching
that
'
s
done
on
the
samsung
.

size
and
shape
:
samsung
e2252
is
bigger
is
size
but
position
and
shape
of
keypad
along
with
bigger
screen
is
designed
in
a
way
that
phone
itself
feels
waf

samsung
now
bigger
than
nokia
in
mobile

today
samsung
is
25
%
bigger
than
nokia
.

samsung
has
a
0

5
inch
bigger
screen
than
nokia

after
the
incident
,
i
scaled
down
and
bought
a
very
basic
tata
samsung
phone
,
which
incidentally
had
better
clarity
and
reception
than
my
earlier
nokia
devie
.

the
quality
from
the
nokia
is
definitely
poorer
than
the
samsung
.

samsung
phones
hav
better
camera
and
music
quality
than
nokia
.

i
have
now
shifted
onto
samsung
as
they
are
providing
better
quality
than
microsoft
-
nokia
combine
.

nokia
are
really
the
lowest
quality
among
the
established
brands
,
ans
statistics
from
my
carrier
show
that
their
service
is
slower
than
sony
and
samsung
,
where
sony
managed
to
return
93
%
of
phones
within
6
days
nokia
barely
made
it
to
60
%.

in
fact
,
when
playing
around
with
the
music
player
it
is
obvious
that
samsung
also
make
dedicated
mp3
players
,
and
overall
the
quality
of
the
player
seems
to
be
much
better
than
on
a
similar
nokia
phone
.

its
priced
is
at

moves
///
slow
but
surely
general
price
of
nokia
phones
are
cheaper
than
samsung
.

samsung
,
htc
to
price
wp8
models
cheaper
than
nokia
,
digitimes
reports
samsung
(
ssnlf
)
and
htc
are
expected
to
price
wp8
models
at
cheaper
rates
to
counter
comparable
models
from
nokia
(
nok
),
reports
digitimes
.

the
moto
x
and
nexus
5
have
somewhat
cheaper
camera
hardware
(
just
like
samsung
has
cheaper
camera
hardware
than
nokia
).

the
samsung
focus
2
is
a
cheaper
alternative
to
range
-
topping
windows
phones
like
the
nokia
lumia
900
.

that
or
the
samsung
renown
,
or
the
casio
exilim
,
all
recent
-
enough
phones
,
with
better
cameras
than
the
lg8600
,
the
nokia
is
especially
nice
and
thin
,
and
none
of
them
require
the
data
package
.

so
no
nokia
n8
is
not
superior
to
sgs3
or
iphone
5
,
it
is
not
even
beat
samsung
fascinate
which
only
has
5mp
camera
module
.

for
example
he
was
acclaiming
,
that
nokia

has
a
worse
camera
,
than
se
satio
or
samsung
s8500
.

samsung
has
dslr
cameras
,
of
course
they
are
better
than
nokia

and
both
samsung
and
sony
u
..

samsung
phones
are
doing
much
better
than
nokia
.

samsung
,
htc
and
others
will
launch
their
phones
faster
than
nokia
.

samsung
made
better
s60
phones
than
nokia
back
when
they
still
bothered
.

1tb
of
mechanical
storage
isn
'
t
bad
,
but
toshiba
hard
drives
really
aren
'
t
what
we
want
to
be
seeing
as
they
tend
to
be
a
bit
slower
than
competing
drives
from
hgst
,
western
digital
,
samsung
,
and
seagate
.

the
toshiba
player
is
also
significantly
cheaper
than
the
samsung
.

so
decided
to
go
with
toshiba
since
it
was
almost
300
cheaper
than
samsung
.

the
build
quality
of
the
samsung
does
not
rival
the
cheaper
of
the
two
toshiba
units
.

although
toshiba
is
a
market
leader
in
japan
but
as
far
as
the
hold
in
uk
market
is
concerned
then
there
is
an
edge
for
samsung
as
the
price
of
samsung
samsung
lcd
tv
'
s
are
much
more
cheaper
than
toshiba
with
several
other
added
features
.

the
problem
is
that
the
toshiba
drives
are
noticeably
slower
than
the
newer
samsung
drives
.

in
comparing
the
three
tvs
,
the
newer
lg
and
toshiba
models
had
comparable
contrast
,
and
both
models
showed
improvement
over
the
first
-
gen
samsung
.

the
samsung
drives
are
slightly
faster
than
the
toshiba
drives
.

samsung
ssds
read
and
write
speeds
are
significantly
faster
than
the
toshiba
ssds
.

the
samsung
takes
second
place
,
being
just
a
little
faster
than
the
toshiba
.

notably
,
the
samsung
ssds
registered
significantly
faster
read
and
write
speeds
than
the
toshiba
ssds
.

according
to
tests
(
chart
below
)
the
samsung
ssd
is
significantly
faster
than
the
toshiba
version
.

i
know
little
about
hard
disk
benchmarks
,
but
the
samsung
looks
like
it
is
quite
a
bit
faster
than
the
toshiba
.

the
toshiba
bits
that
are
inside
my
air
,
from
october
,
are
actually
slower
than
those
in
the
latest
batch
,
which
house
an
ssd
blade
from
samsung
.

that
'
s
a
bit
reminiscent
of
a
similar
issue
with
the
2011
machines
,
if
you
got
the
toshiba
-
based
ssd
,
you
got
slower
performance
than
the
samsung
.

weak
memory
chip
prices
remain
the
biggest
concern
for
samsung
in
the
third
quarter
,
but
it
will
again
fare
better
than
rivals
as
its
reliance
on
apple
,
which
tends
to
squeeze
suppliers
quite
a
bit
,
is
small
compared
to
the
likes
of
hynix
and
toshiba
.

the
good
news
is
that
even
in
this
state
the
toshiba
drive
is
faster
than
the
previous
generation
apple
ssds
,
the
bad
news
is
the
new
samsung
based
drive
is
significantly
quicker
.

the
company
'
s
investors
include
samsung
electronics
,
an
even
bigger
flash
-
memory
supplier
than
toshiba
.

samsung
was
also
bigger
than
the
accumulated
totals
of
toshiba
,
no
.
4
micron
technology
and
fifth
-
ranked
elpida
memory
.

while
toshiba
invented
the
chips
more
than
a
decade
ago
,
samsung
has
seized
the
lead
with
bigger
production
volumes
and
lower
prices
.

i
mean
,
a
512gb
ssd
is
clearly
for
bragging
rights
,
but
it
'
s
toshiba
'
s
biggest
and
fastest
drive
made
in
-
house
-
way
nicer
than
we
see
competition
from
lenovo
and
apple
(
which
we
believe
to
both
use
earlier
gen
,
samsung
drives
).

this
means
that
samsung
microsd
cards
should
naturally
carry
a
slightly
higher
price
than
toshiba
/
sandisk
cards
.

toshiba
and
seagate
share
the
second
spot
,
and
samsung
falls
behind
because
of
its
higher
power
consumption
at
peak
streaming
reads
.

however
,
it
could
not
match
up
to
the
stellar
performance
of
the
samsung
galaxy
tab
7
.
7
simply
because
the
samsung
slate
has
a
higher
capacity
5100mah
battery
,
which
actually
weighed
less
than
the
toshiba
slate
.

the
toshiba
z830
is
a
half
pound
lighter
than
the
samsung
series

or
macbook
air
,
and
just
a
bit
smaller
all
around
.

we
were
interested
in
toshiba
after
we
saw
that
toshiba
was
better
than
samsung
because
it
had
clear
picture
and
extreme
sound
.

i
have
seen
it
from
my
own
eyes
the
picture
on
the
toshiba
is
way
better
than
the
samsung
!

toshiba
and
jvc
have
gotten
consistently
better
scores
in
testing
in
various
home
theater
magazines
than
samsung
(
a
very
digital
picture
)
or
mitsubishi
(
more
noise
than
some
others
).

i
'
ve
got
a
toshiba
37
1080p
in
the
front
room
which
was
more
than
twice
the
price
and
the
picture
is
better
on
the
samsung
,
sound
is
also
better
,
really
slim
design
.

i
think
the
toshiba
still
presents
a
slightly
sharper
picture
overall
when
compared
to
the
samsung
.

my
$
2000
samsung
3d
led
tv
has
worse
sound
than
my
30
-
year
old
toshiba
25
clunker
because
the
speakers
face
the
brick
wall
behind
it
.

the
toshiba
sound
is
much
crisper
than
the
rather
touching
bakelite
fuzz
of
the
samsung
,
too
.

design
toshiba
makes
much
of
the
at200
'
s
thinness
,
and
rightly
so
:
at
7
.
7mm
it
'
s
slimmer
than
the
samsung
galaxy
tab
10
.
1
(
8
.
6mm
)
and
the
'
new
'
ipad
(
9
.
4mm
),
although
there
'
s
every
likelihood
that
something
thinner
will
appear
before
long
and
steal
its
thunder
.
